# Fake News Detector (ML Project)

This project is a Fake News Detection System built using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It can classify whether a given news article is Real or Fake using a trained model on a labeled dataset.

## Overview

- Text Preprocessing (stopwords removal, stemming)
- Model: Passive Aggressive Classifier
- Vectorization: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- Dataset used: train.csv and test.csv

## Dataset

The dataset consists of real and fake news headlines and article texts. It was used to train and test the model.

## How It Works

1. User inputs news text
2. Text is transformed using the same trained TF-IDF vectorizer
3. Model predicts whether the news is fake or real

## Results

Achieved decent accuracy using simple ML models. This project helped me understand:
- Text classification
- Preprocessing text data
- Model training and prediction in Python

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Try it out

You can run the notebook using Jupyter or upload it to Google Colab.

## About Me

I'm currently learning Python and Machine Learning. This is one of my first practical ML projects â€” created with guidance and curiosity.  
I'm open to feedback and improvement ideas.
